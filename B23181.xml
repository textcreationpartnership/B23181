            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And know this my Friends, henceforth you are not your own, for you are bought with a price, and you are called with an holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that you might glorifie the Lord in your bodies and ſpirits which are the Lords: Oh my Friends! let not your delight be placed in the things of this world, for then will you be intangled, but wait in the feeling of the pure power of the Lord God, that ye may be kept and preſerved thereby, that ſo ye that marry may be as if you married not, and ye that have of this world, as if ye poſſeſsed not, and that ye may be kept in the living wiſdome of God, in the ordering of all things that are given unto you, that ſo the glory of God, and the honour of his eternall truth, may be minded in all things; and that your minds and hearts may be drawn out of all created things, and ye kept ſingle and chaſt unto the Lord, that ſo, if it were his will, that ye ſhould be ſeperated either from wife, or husband (outwardly) or Children, or Houſes, or Lands, or any outward thing for his name ſake, that ye may be kept in that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and frame of mind and ſpirit, that ye may reſign up all freely without murmuring, that ſo ye may be known to be followers of the Lamb, whitherſoever he goeth for my babes it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, as well to ſuffer for his namesſake as to believe, and hereby ſhall the world know that ye are redeemed from the earth, if ye in patience and innocency give up to the will of God in all things: Therefore dear hearts, wait in the power and life of God, that ye may feel your ſtrength and courage and boldneſs for the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that when you are tryed, ye may ſtand in that ſpirit of life and meekneſs, which will give you eternal peace, in all your ſufferings and tryalls, for the Lord will try you, that ye may ſee, and know him alone to be your ſtrength, and that the world may know, that ye are a people ſaved by the almighty God; and this know, that ye that are faithfull, ſhall not be proved beyond your ſtrength, for the Lord will be with you in all your tryals, and the more that you are perſecuted for his name, the greater ſhal his power be felt in you, and the more your enemies afflict you, the greater ſhal be your joy, and this ſhall torment your enemies: So friends let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing, for the Lord will make up his Jewels, and he will take away all the droſs, and nothing ſhall remain, but that which will abide the trial in the fire, for the Lord hath been loathed with the ſacrifices of many, who have profeſſed his name, but have not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204170:4"/>been ſubject to the leadings of his ſpirit, but have grived it from day to day; Therefore will the Lord God try all profeſſions, and the chaffe ſhall be blown away, and all falſe coverings ſhall be ſtript off, and men ſhall appear as they are; yea the chaſſe which ſome time ſeemed to joyn to the wheate, ſhall be driven to and fro, untill the fire conſume it, or untill, it mixe it ſelf with the mire where the ſwine walloweth; but God will have regard unto his ſeed which is weighty: And friends, a day of calamity wil come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who have worſhipped, and do worſhip an unknown God at a diſtance, and pretend the worſhip of the true God, for they ſhalt call but their God ſhall not anſwer, and they ſhall fret them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; fear and terror ſhal ſieze upon them, &amp; many ſhal joyn to, and fall under that, which they have called &amp; eſteemed Babiloniſh: But there is a Remnant yet to be gathered, both from among the profeſſors, and prophane: Therefore dear hearts, let your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect walking in the life of righteouſneſs, reach the witneſs of God in all conſciences, and let your ſoberneſs and patience ſmite your enemies. And you that are ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, are able to endure much, bear ye with the weak, and incourage and ſtrengthen the feeble, and let your tender love and care be over ſuch, as ye feel have true breathings after the Lord, though they have have little of a knowledge of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth; and let your words to, and before them and all men, be ſeaſoned with grace, that ye may miniſter unto the grace in the hearers.</p>
            <p>And ye that are weak, and yet have a true Love, begotten in you towards the Lord; all wait in the feeling of the truth in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, that your minds may be wrought into ſubjection to the Lord, through the working of his eternal power in you; and when you are tempted, heed not the temptation, but heed the light that makes manifeſt the temptation, and believe in the light and keep to it, and ye will feel the Lords preſence and ſtrength break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to deliver you, and to make a way for you to eſcape the temptation; and if at any time ye be overcome by the ſubtilty of the Devil, and then the light ariſe in you, to make manifeſt the tranſgreſſion, and to Judge you for it, then joyn to the light, and love the judgment, and will not, but be ſtill, until it works through, and breaks forth into victory; and if ye ſee iniquity abound, then take heed that your love wax not cold; and if ye ſee ſome fall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204170:4"/>from the truth, and turn back with the dogg to the vomit, and with the ſwine that was waſhed, to the wallowing again in the mire; and if ye ſee ſome for fear of perſecution ſtart aſide, or for the love of this world depart from the faith, or turn from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commandment, which was delivered unto them upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever; let none of theſe things move or trouble you, for ſuch things will come to paſs; but bleſſed are they that are not offended with the light, but ſuffers and endures all things unto the end, for they ſhall be ſaved: But this know friends, that the Lord God will try you, and ye muſt paſs through perils and tryals, not only among the open prophane ones, but alſo among ſuch as have known the truth, and turns from it; yet know my friends, that God will not try you further than he will give you ſtrength to endure the tryal, if ye be faithful unto him. Therefore watch and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and waite in the life, that ye may have ſalt in your ſelves to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor withal; and be not weary, neither faint in your minds, nor let not in diſtruſt, but hope to the end, and be confident that God will appear and work deliverance for his people; but if it be his will that ye muſt yet be further tryed, and that he will yet ſuffer the wicked to flouriſh, &amp; ſpread forth themſelves as a green bay-tree, and that ye muſt yet bear your teſtimony for the Lord by greater ſufferings; Oh friends murmur not! but hold faſt your integrity, and know certainly, that whatſoever any ſuffer for the Lord, they ſhall not looſe their reward: Therefore all friends, be valiant and ſtrong, and bold for the truth upon earth; and walk humbly with the Lord, and wiſely before your enemies, that ſo, ye by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing that is right in the ſight of God, may put to ſilence the fooliſh and ignorant, for this is the will of God. And friends, walk patiently towards all men, knowing that ye ſometimes were ignorant and fooliſh, and diſobedient; therefore let your pitty and patience towards them (that be diſobedient) be known, and wait that ye may be ready to ſhew them the thing that is good, &amp; to inſtruct them concerning the way of righteouſneſs, or if you have not words given you, then let you converſation preach forth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that ſo happily God may give ſome of them repentance, and that ye may be made inſtruments for the bringing them unto the acknowledgment and knowledge of the truth, and live in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of God, that ſo your enemies may have nothing againſt you juſtly, but if they will perſecute you for any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204170:5"/>to a good conſcience, be not diſmaid; or if they falſely accuſe you, and falſely ſweare againſt you, and ſo ye reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the tranſgreſſors by them, be not troubled, but be patient and keep to the witneſs of God; for thus the wicked ſerved your Maſter, who gave his back to the ſmiter, and his cheeks unto them that plucked of the hair, and the ſervant is not greater than his Lord: So let nothing be too dear to be given up for the Lord, and bow not to any thing, but to the name of Jeſus, whoſe name is called the word of God, by which we muſt overcome and break through all this ungodlineſs: Oh the Lord keep you faithful and patient in your tryals, for much have we to paſs through and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, through the patience and long-ſuffering of the Lamb: So let none be exalted above their meaſures, nor caſt down by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of fears, but all dwell in the living nobility of the immortal king of righteouſneſs, and keep in ſubjection to his government, and meet together oft in his name, though the Sea and the heathen Rage, and the people imagin vain things, and though the Kings of the earth, and the Rulers riſe up together, and take counſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lamb, and his followers; and though the rude multitude may perſecute you, and the whore may drink ſome of your blood, yet be not diſmaid, neither fear ye at all, for in vain do they ſtrive, for the Lamb ſhall get the victory; glory to him in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</p>
            <p>And ſo friends, keep your garments unſpotted, ye, who have waſhed them in the blood of the Lamb, and be exceeding tender toward ſuch profeſſors as have a tenderneſs in them towards God, in what ſect ſoever they be in, for poor creatures they are to be pittied, and the way of truth is to be ſhewn unto them, and this day will bring ſome of them unto the principle of God in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they muſt come unto that, before they can find a true ſtay to their minds; and them that comes not to that and keeps not to that, will wither as the graſs upon the houſe top. On friends! I can even rejoyce and ſing for joy, notwithſtanding the rage and ſtrength of the enemies, for I ſee the day that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will be exceeding good for truth, and for friends that dwell in it; for they that ſtand approved ſhall be made manifeſt, and the upright ſhall not looſe, but gain through all theſe things, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when our God hath tryed us to the full, he will appear for us; and though our enemies were as the ſand of the Sea, and as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204170:5"/>ſtrong as Gyants, yet ſhall they fall as the untimely fruit, and our God ſhall conſume and weaken them by the majeſty of his power, and an exceeding diſſolation ſhall come upon the earth, and a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of deſtruction ſhall ſweep away many.</p>
            <p>Therefore dear hearts, be ſtedfaſt in the Lord, and keep the word of his patience, and know, that not one hair of your heads ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, nor any thing ſhall be done unto any of you, but what the Lord will be glorified by, and you ſhall receive a full and a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reward for it, if ye continue faithful; So live in the power and ſeed of God, that ye may poſſeſs the kingdome, the eternal peace, joy and tighteouſneſs, which ſtands in the power; And love fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Oh friends, let that abound more and more one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by this ſhall men alſo know, that ye are taught of Chriſt, if ye love one another; and wait that ye may feel the ſprings of life in your ſelves, and feed upon that which proceeds from God, that ye may grow up in the power and life, and wiſdome of God, and therein be eſtabliſhed: So the almighty power, life and wiſdome of God, keep and preſerve you for ever Amen; the Lord God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty keep you freſh and lively, meek, tender, and innocent, and fill you with every good word, and work, which accompanieth peace, and godlineſs; If any decree unrighteous decrees, heed them not, for the decree of God ſhall ſtand, which is, to eſtabliſh righteouſneſs in the earth, and in the power of the Lord, we ſhall break the bonds of the ungodly, and caſt their cords from us; So the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al weapon war withal, and ſtand in the faith, and hold faſt the word of truth, that through it you may feel and witneſs your ſanctification, and the birth immortal raiſed up over all, which is the heir of the Kingdome, without end, and aſſuredly God will do mighty things for his people; therefore be ye comforted and ſtrengthened in the Lord, and dwell in and keep his covenant, and anſwer his requirings in the light of life, and live in the retiredneſs, and in the wiſdome of God, that your enemies may have no juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion againſt you, and that ye may be preſerved out of their ſnares, and if they impriſon you, and falſely accuſe you, or ſpoil your goods, or perſecute you any manner of wayes, keep in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and freely forgive them, and ſuffer as Lambs in the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, that ſo your peace with the Lord may be preſerved in all conditions.</p>

               <hi>And Friends, let the dread and majeſty of God fill you, and as concerning the changing of Times and Governments; let not that trouble any of you, for God hath a mighty work, and hand therein, and he will yet change again until that come up, which muſt reign; and in vain ſhall Powers and Armies withſtand the Lord, for his determined work ſhall come to paſs; but what is now come up, i'ts juſt with the Lord that it ſhould be ſo, and he will be ſerved by it: Therefore let none murmure, nor diſtruſt God, for God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke many to zeal againſt unrighteouſneſs, and for righteouſneſs, through things which are ſuffered now to work for a ſeaſon; yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whoſe zeal was even dead, ſhall revive again, and they ſhall ſee their backslidings, and bewail them bitterly, and God ſhall than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der down from heaven, and break forth in a mighty noyſe, and his Enemies ſhall be aſtoniſhed, and the workers of Iniquity confounded, and all that have not on the garment of righteouſneſs, ſhall be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the mighty and ſtrange work of the Lord, which ſhall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly brought to paſs; but my babes look ye not out, but be ſtill in the light of the Lamb, and he ſhall fight for you: So the Almighty hand which muſt break, and ſplit, and divide your enemies, and take away peace from them, preſerve and keep you whole, and in unity, and in peace with it ſelf, and one with another.</hi>
